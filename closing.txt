Hello %displayname%!  To you reading this message, I regret to inform you this software is no longer supported by the developer.  They have decided to cease development due to the complexity of the operations needed to keep this software up to date in the Java Runtime Environment.  Don't fret though! A new software is available.  Meet the Arizotaz Portal, it a combination of features, all located in one designated application.  With the basic application launching functionality, friend support, Arizotaz images, and cloud support, it is much more versatile.  The new software is also build in a more efficient language.  Best of all, the portal will keep all applications up to date even if the portal itself is closed.  We hope to see you there!
